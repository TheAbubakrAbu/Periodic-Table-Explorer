# Periodic Table Explorer

**Periodic Table Explorer** is an interactive Java console application designed to help users explore, search, and test their knowledge of the periodic table. I developed this project in my junior year of high school (11th grade) during Spring 2023 as part of my **IB Computer Science Internal Assessment (IA)** for the **Standard Level (SL)** course.

My class was the first at our school to take IB Computer Science, making us the "test group." As the pilot group, we faced challenges such as limited resources and preparation time for both students and our teacher. Despite these challenges, I earned an **A** in the class and achieved the highest score in the classâ€”a **6/7** on the IB Computer Science SL exam.

## About the Project

The project addresses a challenge faced by high school chemistry students who struggle to memorize elements of the periodic table, particularly after features on popular platforms like Quizlet became paywalled. This application provides a free, accessible tool that enables users to:
- Browse and view all periodic table elements and their attributes.
- Search for elements by name or symbol.
- Test their memorization skills through customizable quizzes.

Built entirely as a **console-based application**, this project showcases techniques like object-oriented programming, recursion, 2D arrays, and nested loops. It was designed to run on any computer with browser-based access to **[Coding Rooms](https://app.codingrooms.com/w/Yxexan1LM35u)**, the development environment used during implementation.

## What is the IB and IA?

The **International Baccalaureate (IB)** is a globally recognized educational program with a rigorous curriculum that encourages critical thinking and problem-solving. The **Internal Assessment (IA)** is a core component of the IB Computer Science curriculum, where students independently design, build, and evaluate software to solve a real-world problem. This project was created for the **SL (Standard Level)** course, focusing on foundational computer science concepts.

## Features

1. **Explore Elements**: Display details like atomic number, symbol, weight, and phase for all 118 elements in ascending order.
2. **Search Tool**: Look up elements by name or symbol with relevant results displayed instantly.
3. **Customizable Quizzes**:
   - Choose free-response, multiple-choice, or a mix of both.
   - Select atomic number ranges or specify the number of questions.
   - Receive optional hints to support learning.
4. **User-Friendly Console Interface**: Clear, step-by-step text prompts make navigation straightforward.

## Context and Development Highlights

The application was created for a high school chemistry teacher who wanted to provide her students with a free, effective tool for learning the periodic table. The element data was sourced from [code.org](https://code.org), ensuring reliability and accuracy. 

While the project achieved its objectives, feedback from the client and users suggested potential improvements, including:
- Adding additional attributes like discovery history and electron configuration.
- Enhancing search functionality to allow queries by group or type.
- Replacing the console interface with a graphical user interface (GUI) for better usability.
